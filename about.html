            <p class="text">Ontology Network is a diverse, integrated, distributed trust network and the infrastructure for building a trust ecosystem. Ontology encourages trust cooperation and allows projects of all shapes, sizes, and technologies with different business scenarios and compliance requirements to pass through Ontology’s chain networks and take advantage of the distributed trust network how they see fit.</p>

            <p class="text">Ontology Network has become the first blockchain project from China to join the Decentralized Identity Foundation, which aims to build a standardized decentralized ecosystem for online identities. Also, Ontology has been involved in ISO/IEC TC307 and CBD Forum’s blockchain open source project.</p>

                    <p class="text">Ontology Network and its distributed ledgers use a decoupled architecture that can
                        support multiple blockchains and traditional IT systems as the underlying layer. At the ledger
                        level there is a distributed ledger framework with smart contact support and customization for
                        different scenarios. At the application level there are multiple modules and protocols for
                        specific business processes to improve the scalability and flexibility of the entire
                        architecture.</p>

                    <p class="text">In its first stage, Ontology Network uses a series of core protocols including those for identity authentication, authorization, and data exchange. The protocols are compatible internationally and with the W3C. The cryptographic signature protocols also support the Chinese national cryptography standard, RSA, and ECC. In the distributed data exchange system, there is also compatibility with UMA to make the data exchange system open, standardized, and ready for future cooperation and expansion.</p>

                    <p class="text">As the foundational infrastructure of a trust ecosystem, Ontology Network supports the development and upkeep of decentralized technology and data systems. Taking on the technical legwork, Ontology lets its partners focus on their business operations. Ontology provides a series of application frameworks including APIs, SDKs, and various application modules. These allow application service providers with a wide range of technical backgrounds to develop their own dApps, making decentralized systems accessible for all.</p>
